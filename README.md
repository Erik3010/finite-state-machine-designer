# Finite State Machine Designer

![Finite State Machine Designer Preview](https://github.com/Erik3010/finite-state-machine-designer/blob/master/preview.png?raw=true)

## Description

This project is a simple Finite State Designer that allows you to create, edit and visualize finite state machines. It is built using Javascript and HTML Canvas. You can try the live version [here](https://erik3010.github.io/finite-state-machine-designer).

I created this project to enhance my javascript canvas and gain some experience with simple trigonometry, as it involves some basic trigonometry calculations. If you find any bugs or you want to add some features, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

## Features

- Create a new state by **double-clicking** on the blank space
- Move the state by **dragging** it to the desired location
- Change the state to accept state by **double-clicking** on the state
- Create an arrow by holding the **shift** key and **dragging** from the current state to the target state
- Delete the object (state or arrow) by selected on them and pressing the **delete** key
- Export the design to a PNG file by pressing the **export** button

## Upcoming Features

- [ ] Save the design to the local storage
- [ ] Load the design from the local storage
- [ ] Create arrow from any space in canvas
