# Finite State Machine Designer

## Description

This is a fun project that I created to enhance my javascript canvas and gain some experience with simple trigonometry, as it involves some basic trigonometry calculations. It is a simple Finite State Machine Designer that allows you to create and edit Finite State. You can also export the design to the PNG image.

## Upcoming Features

- [ ] Save the design to the local storage
- [ ] Load the design from the local storage
